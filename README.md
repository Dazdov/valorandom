# what is valorandom


valorand is a name for the game me and my friends invented which is valorant (an online tactical shooter) + (our change) the element of randomness and silliness


# how do i use it?

just run either of the exe files or make edits to the code!


# what is the diffrence between the 2 versions?

one of them is using my version of odds while the other uses my friend's "tutel"


# i dont see noticable diffrence?


at this point not much is diffrent at the start of those 2 version they were completely diffrent but over the course of a couple of months i refined both our codes to be a lil bit better but still keeping those 2 seperate files in case one of us wants to change it, tutel is not a c dev this version is rewritten in c by me from java


# is there any other purpose to that?

originally it started as a lil bit of a competition to see who can make a faster and less biased code but considering the it was me using c vs them using java,it was rigged from the start to say the least.


# i will try to update it according to updates of the game in the future and will try to integrade abilities to it (might migrate to c++ or python) stay tuned!
